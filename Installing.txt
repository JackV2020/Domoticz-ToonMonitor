    Required actions to get communication with Toon setup.
    Optional actions if you want vnc on Toon 1 or Toon 2
    Optional actions if you want sftp on Toon, if not installed already
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Required actions to get communication with Toon setup.

 1) Enable ssh without passwords.
 2) Copy reporting script to Toon.

 All devices as already configured in ToonMonitor.conf will work.

 Details are below.........

--- 1) Enable ssh without passwords.

 You will enable passwordless ssh for root account to Toon.

  A) On Domoticz host be root
        sudo -i
  B) generate keys 
        - ls ~/.ssh/id_rsapub
        - when there is an id_rsapub file there, skip to step C because it would generate a new one.
        ( if already done before it will exit by default which is good ) 
        ssh-keygen 
           ( 4 x enter so no typing just enter, enter,...)
  C) Copy public key to Toon
		( change ToonIPAddress to your Toon IP address )
        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ToonIPAddress
      like
        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@192.168.1.123
        ( accept key offer and enter password which is most probably toon )
  D) Test
        ( when it fails you may need to "Restore password" in menu on Toon and retry and maybe even try option F below )
        ssh root@ToonIPAddress hostname
        ssh root@ToonIPAddress
        exit
        ssh root@ToonIPAddress hostname
  E) Leave root
		 exit
  F) When the test failed even after "Restore password" on Toon.....
        The ssh-copy-id of step C just needs to add the contents of the text file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        into the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in the folder of root on your Toon.
        So I started an ssh session to my toon and made sure there was this .ssh folder
        - ssh root@toon
        ( enter password toon )
        - ls .ssh
        - when the folder is not there : mkdir .ssh
        - cd .ssh
        now in a different terminal window on Pi :
        - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        select all lines of the output with your mouse, right click and select copy
        ( might be 5 line looking like : ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E.....Ibe3na88USFc= root@pi41.home )
        now in the toon terminal where you are in the .ssh folder add the paste buffer to authorized keys :
        - echo "<right mouse click and paste>" >> authorized_keys
        like : echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E.....Ibe3na88USFc= root@pi41.home" >> authorized_keys
        I did the test in D again and it worked :-)

        However....
        
        I had this issue on laptop running Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS.
        I still needed to enter a password. So in my ~/.ssh folder I created a file named config
        and put in the next two lines and save the file :
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-rsa

        And later, on my laptop, I had this issue with github and added something more :
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa,ssh-ed25519
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-rsa,ssh-ed25519

    
Note on the actions above :
    You can use this to any host you want to enable passwordless ssh/rsync/sftp/... to.

--- 2) Copy reporting script to Toon.

Okay, now you have passwordless access and are ready to put the reporting script in place and use it.

  A) Copy file to Toon ( change ToonIPAddress to your Toon IP address ) :
        sudo rcp /home/pi/domoticz/plugins/ToonMonitor/toon-performance.sh root@ToonIPAddress:toon-performance.sh
  B) make script executable :
        sudo ssh root@ToonIPAddress chmod +x toon-performance.sh
  C) test
     sudo ssh root@ToonIPAddress ./toon-performance.sh

 Now things are ready for Domoticz.

 Note :

 The command you used for testing is also used by the plugin to get the data.

 The command used to restart Toon :
        ssh root@ToonIPAddress /sbin/init 6

 The command used to restart the gui :
        ssh root@ToonIPAddress /usr/bin/killall qt-gui

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Optional actions if you want vnc on Toon 1 or Toon 2
 
 Remember vnc on Toon 2 is view only but still handy for screenshots.
 
 Note that Toon 1 is not a 8 CPU 8GB machine so everything takes a while....

 On a Toon 1 be patient in the process below
 
 The below does not only contain instructions but also some screen output I had
 
 Commands to be entered are behind a # and are not always the same for Toon 1 and Toon 2

 All you need to do is copy what is after the # signs and paste them on Toon

 So you may read everything or skip to the #-es only ;-)

 ------------ VNC Server installation

 Use putty or another ssh tool to logon to Toon

 Check if x11vnc is installed :

 # which x11vnc

 When it is there you may want to reset the password. 
 See the section Reset vnc password at the end of this instruction.
 
 When there is nothing returned you can install x11vnc so continue

 ---- Update repositories

 To be able to install x11vnc we need to update first.
 To be able to install or update we need to open a vpn.

 Open the vpn 
 ( safe according to https://www.domoticaforum.eu/viewtopic.php?t=12919 )

 # sh update-rooted.sh -o
 ( and give the right answers to continue executing the script like : yes, yes )

 Only start VPN and then quit
 Now starting the VPN tunnel and waiting for it to be alive and configured...

 VPN is started, OPKG sources should now be available for you. Good luck!
 If you are done with manual package downloading, just reboot and the VPN should be closed again.


 NOTE the last line above that after installation we need to reboot to close the VPN.
 Now the VPN is open we can update.

---- Find out which version we need to install

 The x11vnc version depends on the ssl version.
 So check openssl version :

 # openssl version
 OpenSSL 1.0.2p  14 Aug 2018

 Newer fw versions with openssl 1.0.2h and later will need r3, older ones use r0.

---- Method 1 ( if it does not work use Method 2 )

 Depending on your fw version download the file you need for r0 or r3 :

 # opkg install http://files.domoticaforum.eu/uploads/Toon/ipk/qb2/x11vnc_0.9.13-r0_qb2.ipk
 or
 # opkg install http://files.domoticaforum.eu/uploads/Toon/ipk/qb2/x11vnc_0.9.13-r3_qb2.ipk

 Skip Method 2 and go to 'Check installation'

---- Method 2 if Method 1 does not work.

 Download your installer package :

 Start web browser for http://files.domoticaforum.eu/index.php?cam=

 Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select : Toon > ipkg > qb2

 Depending on your fw version download the file you need for r0 or r3 :

 x11vnc_0.9.13-r0_qb2.ipk OR x11vnc_0.9.13-r3_qb2.ipk

 Create the folder /root/downloads on Toon

 On Toon :
 # mkdir download

 On your host :
 # sudo rcp your-file  root@ToonIPAddress:/root/downloads/your-file 

 On Toon :
 # cd downloads

 # opkg install x11vnc_0.9.13-r3_qb2.ipk
 Installing x11vnc (0.9.13-r3) to root...
 Multiple replacers for glibc, using first one (libc6).
 Multiple replacers for zlib, using first one (libz1).
 Multiple replacers for jpeg, using first one (libjpeg8).
 Multiple replacers for jpeg, using first one (libjpeg8).
 Configuring x11vnc.

---- Check installation

 # which x11vnc
 /usr/bin/x11vnc

 Setup x11vnc and DO NOT FORGET the password you enter here.
 
 (Forgot password ? : delete /root/.vnc/passwd and do the next again )

For Toon 1 : # x11vnc
For Toon 2 : # x11vnc -storepasswd
 Enter VNC password:
 Verify password:
 Write password to /root/.vnc/passwd?  [y]/n
 Password written to: /root/.vnc/passwd
 :
 lost and lots of text

 The SSL VNC desktop is:  eneco-001-338271:0
 PORT=5900
 SSLPORT=5900

---- Configure firewall

 You need to put the next line :
  -A HCB-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5900 --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN -j ACCEPT
 in the file /etc/default/iptables.conf
 
 You may use a tool like FileZilla to edit or use the instructions on joe below

 # joe /etc/default/iptables.conf
 press arrow down until you are on the beginning of the line below the --dport 22
 press enter and enter the line with --dport 5900 like below :


 -A HCB-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN -j ACCEPT
 -A HCB-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5900 --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN -j ACCEPT
 -A HCB-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 10080 --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN -j ACCEPT

 to save the file press Ctrl-KX

 File /etc/default/iptables.conf saved.

---- Activate firewall rules

 You can activate the firewall rules by restarting the firewall like :

 # /etc/init.d/iptables restart

 or since we also need to close the VPN just reboot :

 # init 6

 After reboot there was an Eneco message on my Toon which I think was caused by opening the vpn.

---- start x11vnc

 ssh to toon and start x11vnc :

For Toon 1 : # x11vnc
For Toon 2 a long one : # x11vnc -forever -shared -rawfb map:/dev/fb0@1024x600x32 -usepw -pipeinput UINPUT:touch,touch_always=1,abs,pressure=128,direct_abs=/dev/input/event0,direct_btn=/dev/input/event0,direct_rel=/devinput/event0,direct_key=/dev/input/event0,nouinput
 The SSL VNC desktop is:  eneco-001-338271:0
 PORT=5900
 SSLPORT=5900

 Since vnc was configured before no questions are asked

---- stop x11vnc

For Toon 1 : # ps | grep x11vnc
For Toon 2 : # ps -ef | grep x11vnc

For Toon 1 : # killall x11vnc-bin
For Toon 2 : # killall x11vnc

For Toon 1 : # ps | grep x11vnc
For Toon 2 : # ps -ef | grep x11vnc

---- VNC Client Linux

 Install the TigerVNC which is available for your distribution. I use Lubuntu with xfce and it was in my Discover tool.

 I copied /root/.vnc/passwd from Toon to my home folder on my linux laptop where I installed tigervncviewer.
 Now I can use the next command to start tigervnc and it will access toon without me having to enter the vnc password.

 /usr/bin/xtigervncviewer -passwd /home/jack/passwd toon-ip-address

 I use the same VNC password on all my Toons so I have only 1 passwd file in my home folder which works for all of them.

---- VNC Client Windows

 On Windows install tigervnc

 Download windows version from https://tigervnc.en.lo4d.com/windows

 use TigerVNC to connect.

---- VNC Client Android

 install bVNC app

 use bVNC app to connect

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Optional actions if you want sftp on Toon 2

---- Method 1 ( if it does not work use Method 2 )

 ssh to your Toon and

 # opkg install http://files.domoticaforum.eu/index.php?cam=/Toon/ipk/cortexa9hf-vfp-neon/openssh-sftp-server_6.7p1-r0_cortexa9hf-vfp-neon.ipk

 Skip Method 2 and go to 'Check installation'

---- Method 2 if Method 1 does not work.

 Download your installer package :

 Start web browser for :
 http://files.domoticaforum.eu/index.php?cam=/Toon/ipk/cortexa9hf-vfp-neon

 Download openssh-sftp-server_6.7p1-r0_cortexa9hf-vfp-neon.ipk

 Create the folder /root/downloads on Toon

 On Toon :
 # mkdir download

 On your host :
 # sudo openssh-sftp-server_6.7p1-r0_cortexa9hf-vfp-neon.ipk  root@ToonIPAddress:/root/downloads/openssh-sftp-server_6.7p1-r0_cortexa9hf-vfp-neon.ipk

 On Toon :
 # cd downloads

 # opkg install openssh-sftp-server_6.7p1-r0_cortexa9hf-vfp-neon.ipk

---- Check installation

 # ls -l /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
 
---- Use sftp

 There is no need to create a seperate entry in /etc/inittab or in the /etc/rc* directories
 dropbear was installed during rooting and dropbear will start an sftp server when needed
 Just use FileZilla or any other sftp client to access your Toon.
